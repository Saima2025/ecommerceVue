# ecommerceVue

By clicking product page user can search by keyword or also add filter to sort in ascending or descending order .I have used v1/items/serach for this.
After searching one can see the product details by clicking on the search result.The details are rendered from this api - v1/items/{platform}/{item_id}
The search keywords are stored in through the save keyword api.
I have added pagination for search results.
